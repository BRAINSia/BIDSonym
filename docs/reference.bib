	abstract = {Due to the increasing need for subject privacy, the ability to deidentify structural {MR} images so that they do not provide full facial detail is desirable. A program was developed that uses models of nonbrain structures for removing potentially identifying facial features. When a novel image is presented, the optimal linear transform is computed for the input volume (: Neuron 33:341–355; : Neuroimage 23 (Suppl 1):S69–S84). A brain mask is constructed by forming the union of all voxels with nonzero probability of being brain and then morphologically dilated. All voxels outside the mask with a nonzero probability of being a facial feature are set to 0. The algorithm was applied to 342 datasets that included two different T1-weighted pulse sequences and four different diagnoses (depressed, Alzheimer’s, and elderly and young control groups). Visual inspection showed none had brain tissue removed. In a detailed analysis of the impact of defacing on skull-stripping, 16 datasets were bias corrected with N3 (: {IEEE} Trans Med Imaging 17:87–97), defaced, and then skull-stripped using either a hybrid watershed algorithm (: Neuroimage 22:1060–1075, in {FreeSurfer}) or Brain Surface Extractor (: {IEEE} Trans Med Imaging 16:41–54; : Neuroimage 13:856–876); defacing did not appreciably influence the outcome of skull-stripping. Results suggested that the automatic defacing algorithm is robust, efficiently removes nonbrain tissue, and does not unduly influence the outcome of the processing methods utilized; in some cases, skull-stripping was improved. Analyses support this algorithm as a viable method to allow data sharing with minimal data alteration within large-scale multisite projects.},

	title = {Quickshear defacing for neuroimages},
	abstract = {Data sharing offers many benefits to the neuroscience research community. It encourages collaboration and interorganizational research efforts, enables reproducibility and peer review, and allows meta-analysis and data reuse. However, protecting subject privacy and implementing {HIPAA} compliance measures can be a burdensome task. For high resolution structural neuroimages, subject privacy is threatened by the neuroimage itself, which can contain enough facial features to re-identify an individual. To sufficiently de-identify an individual, the neuroimage pixel data must also be removed. Quickshear Defacing accomplishes this task by effectively shearing facial features while preserving desirable brain tissue.},
